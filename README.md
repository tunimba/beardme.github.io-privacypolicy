Beardio ("Beardio", "we", "our") is a mobile application that uses AI-powered technology to apply beard and mustache transformations to user-uploaded photos. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and how we protect your privacy. By using Beardio, you agree to the practices described in this policy.

# 1. Data We Collect

We collect the following categories of data, none of which is linked to your identity:

## User Content

**Photos or Videos** - Used for App Functionality

You may upload or capture photos solely to visualize different beard and mustache styles. Photos are sent temporarily to our AI provider (Replicate, Inc.) for processing and are automatically discarded after the transformation is complete. We do not store, extract, or analyze facial features for identification or profiling purposes.

## Identifiers

**Device ID** - Used for Analytics, and Other Purposes

An anonymous device identifier is collected by AIProxy to ensure secure and reliable AI service routing. This identifier is not linked to your personal identity.

## Purchases

**Purchase History** - Used for App Functionality, and Analytics

If you make in-app purchases, transaction data is processed by Apple and RevenueCat to manage your subscription or credits. This data is used to provide access to premium features and to analyze purchasing trends in aggregate.

## Usage Data

**Product Interaction** - Used for Analytics

We collect anonymous data about how you interact with the app (e.g., screens viewed, features used) through Firebase Analytics. This helps us understand how the app is used and identify areas for improvement.

## Diagnostics

**Crash Data** - Used for App Functionality

Crash reports are collected through Firebase Crashlytics to help us identify and fix issues that affect app stability.

**Other Diagnostic Data** - Used for App Functionality, and Analytics

Additional diagnostic information (e.g., performance metrics, error logs) may be collected to monitor app health and improve reliability.

## Other Data

**Other Data Types** - Used for Other Purposes, and Analytics

# 2. How We Process Your Photos

- **No storage:** Once the transformation is complete, the image is returned to your device and the photo is automatically discarded.
- **No biometric analysis:** The app does not extract or analyze facial features for identification or profiling purposes.
