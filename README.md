BeardMe (“BeardMe”, “we”, “our”) is a mobile application that uses AI-powered technology to apply beard and moustache transformations to user-uploaded photos. This Privacy Policy explains what information we process, how we use it, and how we protect your privacy. By using BeardMe, you agree to the practices described in this policy.

# 1. What Data We Use

We do not collect or retain any personal or biometric data from users.

The following types of data are processed temporarily and only to provide the core functionality of the app:

Photos: You may upload or capture photos solely to visualize different beard and moustache styles.
Face data is never stored or extracted. The photos are used only to apply the requested transformation and are deleted after processing.

# 2. How We Process Your Photos

Temporary processing: Uploaded photos are sent temporarily to our third-party AI provider, Replicate, Inc., for beard and moustache transformation.
No storage: Once the transformation is complete, the image is returned to your device and the photo is automatically discarded.
No biometric analysis: The app does not extract or analyze facial features for identification or profiling purposes.
No human review: All processing is handled by automated models. We do not access or view your images unless you explicitly contact our support team for help.

# 3. Third-Party Services

We use the following third-party services:

Replicate, Inc. – for applying beard and moustache transformations using AI. Replicate’s Privacy Policy explains that uploaded content is only used for temporary processing and not stored or used for profiling.
Apple In-App Purchases – for handling subscription and credit-based transactions securely.
These services process data only to the extent required for their core functions and do not store face data or retain user content.

# 4. Data Retention

Photos and face data: Not stored. Deleted after transformation.
Purchase information: Managed by Apple under its own privacy and retention policies.
No user data is retained or linked to personal identity.

# 5. Security Measures

All photo processing is automated and encrypted during transmission.
No employee has access to your photos unless you explicitly request support.
We do not store, analyze, or share biometric or facial data.

# 6. Children’s Privacy

BeardMe is not designed for users under age 4. We do not knowingly collect any data from children. If you believe data was shared with us in error, please contact us at app.beardme@gmail.com for prompt deletion.

# 7. International Transfers

Some temporary photo processing may occur on cloud servers located outside your country. All processing is done under secure, GDPR-compliant infrastructure.

# 8. Changes to This Policy

We may revise this policy from time to time. Please refer to the "Last updated" date to check for changes.
